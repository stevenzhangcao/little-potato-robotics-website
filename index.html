This is my first year in FTC, but I bring with me two years of VEX IQ experience along with participation in the 2023 Google Girl Powered Robotics Workshop. I’ve always loved things that are fast and dynamic, which makes driving one of my strengths and a role I really enjoy on my team. I also contribute as the TeleOp coder, combining technical skills with strategic decision-making. Beyond robotics, I enjoy playing the violin, tennis, and drawing, and I’ve had the opportunity to travel to eight countries, which has given me a broader outlook on the world. I’m excited to grow as a robotics engineer and collaborate with my team to build innovative robots this season!</p>

This is my first year participating in FTC, and I previously spent a year in VEX IQ. On my current team, I work as a builder and coder, focusing on developing the Huskylens Camera to enhance our robot’s performance. I also attended the 2024 Girl Powered Robotics Workshop to further strengthen my STEM skills and teamwork experience. Outside of robotics, I love exploring the arts and languages - I dance competitively in multiple styles, play two instruments, and speak two languages fluently while learning a third. I also enjoy competitive math, sketching and painting (which I used to compete in), and writing creative narratives.</p>
